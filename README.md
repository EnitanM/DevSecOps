# Week 2's Deliverables
1. Pull the updates in the repo
2. Run the script using `./run.sh` in the terminal in the **flask-app** directory. If this fails, run `chmod +x ./run.sh` to grant permissions and retry `./run.sh`. Run `deactivate` to deactivate the virtual environment.
3. If using Docker, run `docker compose up --build`. Everything is disposed in step 6.
5. In the terminal, there should be 1 passed test for the tests.py file which tests to make sure Team 1 is used to create the message/string.
4. View the running application at (http://localhost:8081)
5. Use `Ctrl + C` to quit
6. If using docker, run `docker compose down` to remove the *flask-app* container
